# Position R

## Goal

The goal is to create a tool where people can create "Positions" where other people in their organisation can vote on. After a certain threshold on votes on the position, it is marked as accepted.
Example: Someone in a tech-company creates a position "Should we switch from nuxt2 to nuxt3?". At first most people will vote no, because they say nuxt3 isn't ready yet. But after some time their standing to this position will change and they can also change their vote on the position.
